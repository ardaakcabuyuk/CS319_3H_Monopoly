# Project Name: Bilpoly (Monopoly Bilkent)

Description
-
**General:**

Monopoly is a multiplayer turn-based game, where each user can control their tokens on the game board by rolling two six-sided dice. The main aim of the game is to make the other players go bankrupt and dominate the market entirely. 

**Game Board:**

The game board contains buildings (like EA, EE, B, FF buildings...), dormitories (like 76th Dormitory, 81th Dormitory...) and iconic places (like Cafeteria, Mayfest, Library...) that are located in Bilkent University. Besides these, some cafes and restaurants in Ankuva and Bilkent Center (like Piel Roja, Bluejay...) are also present on the game board. Also, on the center of the game board, there will be cards of chance and community chest that are functional in mid-game. The board will have Nizamiye (main entrance) as a starting point, Mayfest Parking Lot as free parking and Mr. Atalar’s Office as Jail. The tokens will be Tunus Ring (TMD), Hop scooter, Ferrari, BMW, bike, helicopter.

**Controls:**

Every player will control the game with a mouse by clicking buttons. The dice feature might be implemented with a shortcut on the keyboard. 

**Gameplay:**

The aim is to become the rector of the University by dominating the whole Bilkent by opening Bilkas and Starbuckses to places and pushing the other players to go bankrupt. (Starbucks and Bilka are equivalent to house and hotel in classic Monopoly respectively.) All the classic Monopoly rules currently available also apply to this game. Credit cards will be used instead of paper money in the classic Monopoly. As a new feature, we will have the rule known as the "Free Parking Rule" to our game. In this rule, all money paid by the players to the bank (excluding the land sales) goes to the middle area. While the game continues, whoever comes to the "Free Parking" point gets all the money saved in the middle. When a player opens three Starbuckses in a place, s/he will be allowed to open a Bilka in that place.
