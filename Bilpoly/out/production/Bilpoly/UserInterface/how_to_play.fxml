            <TextArea layoutX="46.0" layoutY="84.0" prefHeight="200.0" prefWidth="411.0" text="OBJECT&#10;The object of the mode is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling property.&#10;Normal Mode&#10;The game will continue until only one player remains bankrupted.&#10;Timed Mode&#10;The game is completed after the initial set time is over. The player with the highest sum of all property and cash wins the game.&#10;PREPARATION&#10;The number of players is determined.&#10;Each player determines her/his game nick and pawn.&#10;The game mode, board and starting amount of money are selected.&#10;All players start the game with the money determined on the game pre-game screen.&#10;THE PLAY&#10;Who will start the game is determined randomly, and then the order that occurs when entering the game is followed.&#10;When it's your turn, click the roll dice button to move your pawn clockwise as much as the dice you rolled. Two or more pawns can stand on the same digit. Depending on the land your pawn is in, you must do one of the following:&#10;Buying buildings and cafes (if not owned by another player).&#10;Paying rent (if another player has bought that property).&#10;Pay fees.&#10;Go to Atalar’s Room.&#10;If you own all the lands in a color group and you come on any of these buildings, you can open Starbuckses and Bilkas on these buildings.&#10;If you run out of money and have to pay a loan, you can mortgage or sell your properties to the bank. If you owe more money to the bank than you can pay by selling your goods, you will go bankrupt and withdraw from the game.&#10;Players cannot borrow money from each other or lend money to each other.&#10;If you roll double dice (that is, the same number comes on both dice you roll), move your pawn forward as usual and move according to the point on which you are standing. After doing what you have to do, roll the dice again and continue the game. If you roll double dice three times in a row, on the third time you will enter Atalar’s Room and cannot advance your pawn.&#10;The last player remaining in the game without going bankrupt wins the game. (Normal Mode)&#10;The player with the most goods at the end of the time wins. (Timed Mode)&#10;BUYING PROPERTY&#10;There are 2 types of buyable property:&#10;&#10;1. Buildings / Courses&#10;2. Cafes / Social Electives&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;If you stand on an unclaimed property, you can buy it. If you decide to buy the property, you must pay the amount written on this household to the bank.&#10;Owning a property allows you to receive rent from all players who have paused on your property. It is an advantage to have all the plots in a color group, i.e., a &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In this case, you can get more rental income by establishing the Starbuckses or Bilka on these plots.&#10;PAYING RENT&#10;If you stand on an owned property, you have to pay the property owner. If the land is mortgaged, the rent is not paid. The game manager ensures automatic rental payment to the property owner. The rental fee is written on the Title Deed Card of that land and changes according to the number of buildings on the land.&#10;If you own all plots in a color group, the rental prices of all vacant buildings in that color group (i.e. plots with no Starbuckses or Bilkas on them) doubles. Even if your properties in a color group are mortgaged, you can get twice the rent for unmortgaged ones.&#10;CAFES&#10;Cafes are bought like any other property. If the cafe you are stopping at is owned, you must pay the amount specified on the cafe deed card. The amount to be paid is specified on the cafe deed card and depends on the total number of cafes that player has.&#10;STARBUCKSES&#10;When you have all the plots in a color group, you can buy a Starbucks (or Starbuckses) and open them to any of these buildings. The price of a Starbucks is stated on the building card.&#10;If you have all of a color group and you go over one of that color group again, you can buy a Starbucks (or Starbuckses).&#10;As long as you can afford to pay, you can buy as many buildings as you want from the bank! If any plot of a color group is mortgaged, you cannot build a Starbucks in that group.&#10;BILKAS&#10;In order to buy a Bilka, you must have three Starbuckses on each plot of a color group. Also, your three Starbuckses turn into a Bilka.&#10;You can open only one Bilka per building.&#10;MORTGAGES&#10;Mortgage a building&#10;First of all, you need to sell all Starbucks and Bilkas on the land to be mortgaged to the bank for half price. Then you can get half the cost of the building from the bank.&#10;When you mortgage a property, you protect your property rights. Another player cannot confiscate your property by paying the mortgage amount to the bank.&#10;Rent cannot be obtained from a mortgaged property; however, you can continue to receive rent from other unmortgaged properties in the same color group.&#10;Remove the mortgage&#10;You must repay the mortgage amount with 10% interest to the bank.&#10;BANKRUPTCY&#10;If you have more debt than you can pay by selling your goods, you will go bankrupt.&#10;If you owe the bank&#10;Transfer all your buildings (with Starbuckses and Bilkas on them destroyed) and your cash to the bank.&#10;If you owe a player&#10;Transfer all your buildings (with Starbuckses and Bilkas on them not destroyed) and your cash to the player.&#10;CHANCE and RECTOR’S WHISPER CARDS&#10;The player standing in one of these squares draws cards from the deck and applies what is indicated on the card.&#10;If the card you draw tells you to move to another place, the game manager will move you in the direction of the arrow. If you pass the Nizamiye, you will get a start fee.&#10;FREE PARKING&#10;Players who come to this point get the money accumulated in the middle. The money to be accumulated is provided by:&#10;Fee points&#10;Atalar’s Room-out compensation&#10;Penalties from Chance and Rector’s Whisper cards&#10;PASS FROM THE NIZAMIYE&#10;Players will receive 2000 Bilcoins with each pass from the order.&#10;ATALAR’S ROOM&#10;Entering Atalar’s Room&#10;You enter the Atalar’s Room if:&#10;you come to the &quot;Go to Atalar's room&quot; section&#10;you receive a Chance or Rector’s Whisper card that says &quot;Enter Atalar’s Room&quot;.&#10;you roll double dice three times in a row&#10;You lose your turn when you enter the jail.&#10;You must proceed straight to Atalar’s Room; even if you pass Nizamiye, you cannot get 2000B.&#10;You can continue to collect rent for your properties while in Atalar’s Room.&#10;Exiting Atalar’s Room&#10;You exit Atalar’s Room if:&#10;you pay 500B penalties before rolling the dice in the next round,&#10;you use the &quot;Get out of Atalar’s Room free&quot; card,&#10;you roll a double dice in one of the three rounds following your entry into Atalar’s Room.&#10;You can stay in the clink for up to three rounds. If you fail to roll double dice at the end of the third round, you will pay a 500B penalty and advance as much as the dice rolled.&#10;&#10;*BILKENT COURSES BOARD&#10;Courses = Buildings&#10;Electives = Cafes&#10;Hour = Bilcoin&#10;Assignments = Starbuckses&#10;A+ = Bilka&#10;Drop a course = Mortgage a building&#10;" AnchorPane.bottomAnchor="41.0" AnchorPane.leftAnchor="46.0" AnchorPane.rightAnchor="45.666666666666686" AnchorPane.topAnchor="84.0" />
